# Yacht Assistant Chatbot

Welcome to the **Yacht Assistant Chatbot**! This Python-based chatbot provides expert assistance in three main areas related to yachting: **Docking**, **Navigation**, and **Weather**. It's powered by OpenAI's GPT-3.5 API, offering real-time responses to your queries about yacht operations, routes, and marine conditions.

## Features

- **Mode-Specific Expertise**: Choose between different modes—`docking`, `navigation`, or `weather`—to get tailored advice for your specific needs.
- **Personalized Conversation History**: The chatbot remembers your last 10 messages for a more contextual response, making the interaction smoother and more intuitive.
- **Safe Query Handling**: If a query falls outside the designated modes (e.g., cooking, finance), the assistant politely declines or redirects the query to a relevant source.
- **Interactive & Adaptive**: The assistant responds dynamically, adjusting to the conversation history and your ongoing needs.

## Modes

The chatbot is divided into three main expertise areas:

1. **Docking**: Get expert advice on yacht docking techniques, mooring, line handling, approaching marinas, and docking safety. 
2. **Navigation**: Receive help on nautical charts, route planning, GPS usage, and hazard avoidance for safe navigation.
3. **Weather**: Discuss marine weather forecasts, wave height, wind patterns, and their impact on yachting activities.

## Installation

To get started, you'll need to install the required dependencies and set up your OpenAI API key.
